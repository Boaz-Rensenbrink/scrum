### Cover Letter for My Future Employer

Dear Ms. or Mr.

I would like to express my interest in the position of question.

Ever since I successfully introduced a made-to-fit agile framework into Singelfilm and coached the organization and its members in adapting the new mindset, I like to practice scrum in my daily life and my journey started to take shape. Sadly Singelfilm developed and maintained an unrealistic company view and strongly started to enforced this unsustainable vision. In combination with a dear family loss and not being able to get the appropriate space within Singelfilm, I decided to go on sabbatical leave and I traveled in Europe, the Middle East & Asia for one year. 

Now my goal was more clear than ever and I tried my luck applying for scrum master roles. Surely I found out this was very ambitious and never landed a second interview.
Not wanting to wait, I opened a freelance company and offered my knowledge & expertise this way. Sadly without luck. I started to volunteer so I wouldn’t alienate myself in an applying bubble and lose my coaching abilities.

**Why do I want to become a Scrum Master:**
I love working with people, I can read them very well and I listen actively to the words not being said. I get energy from the development and growth of people I help, coach. My Girlfriend is from Asia, and overall people from that area are very shy and over-polite. They don’t speak their mind and stand up for their opinion. Since March she is working from home and I coach her every day and see her grow with big jumps in a strong assertive person that will stand up for her opinion in her team or any other group. This makes me so happy, this development, this irreversible growth. Amazing.
I am capable and jumping to grow an entire team or teams, better yet an entire organization!

I would like to have the opportunity to talk to you about my candidacy for the role in question and discuss it in person or over a virtual cup of coffee.

I look forward to your response and your consideration is much appreciated.

With kind regards & thanks in advance,

Sincerely,

Boaz Rensenbrink
